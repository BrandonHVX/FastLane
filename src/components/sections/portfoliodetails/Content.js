                                    Once a business owner defined the needs to take a business to the next level, a decision
                                    maker will define a scope, cost and a time frame of the project.[1] The role of the IT
                                    consultancy company is to support and nurture the company from the very beginning of the
                                    project until the end, and deliver the project not only in the scope, time and cost but also
                                    with complete customer satisfaction.

                                    The scope of a project is linked intimately to the proposed business processes and systems
                                    that the project is going to deliver. Regardless of whether the project is to launch a new
                                    product range or discontinue unprofitable parts of the business, the change will have some
                                    impact on business processes and systems. The documentation of your business processes and
                                    system requirements are as fundamental to project scoping as an architects plans would be to
                                    the costing and scoping of the construction of a building. The most successful business
                                    projects are always those that are driven by an employee who has the authority, vision and
                                    influence to drive the required changes in a business. It is highly unlikely that a business
                                    owner (decision maker or similar) will realize the changes unless one has one of these
                                    people in the employment. However, the project leadership role typically requires
                                    significant experience and skills which are not usually found within a company focused on
                                    day-to-day operations. Due to this requirement within more significant business change
                                    projects/programs, outside expertise is often sought from firms which can bring this
                                    specific skill set to the company.
